# DSCI551- Project

Topic: USC Whispers: An emulated Firebase and a real-time chat application

Concept
In this project, our aim is to develop a platform exclusively for USC students where they can
unwind and socialize. Our platform will allow students to use any username and share their
thoughts freely, visible to all users of the platform. Our app comes with an administrator
interface that allows us to moderate the content by editing or deleting inappropriate messages,
sensitive information, or private data. Additionally, we can save the messages in the record
during high message volume.
